function Get-BroadcastAddress {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Get the broadcast address for a network range.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Get-BroadcastAddress returns the broadcast address for a subnet by performing a bitwise AND operation against the decimal forms of the IP address and inverted subnet mask.

    .INPUTS
        System.String

    .EXAMPLE
        Get-BroadcastAddress 192.168.0.243 255.255.255.0

        Returns the address 192.168.0.255.

    .EXAMPLE
        Get-BroadcastAddress 10.0.9/22

        Returns the address 10.0.11.255.

    .EXAMPLE
        Get-BroadcastAddress 0/0

        Returns the address 255.255.255.255.

    .EXAMPLE
        Get-BroadcastAddress "10.0.0.42 255.255.255.252"

        Input values are automatically split into IP address and subnet mask. Returns the address 10.0.0.43.
