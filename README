BlackMarlinExec ( Seven Degrees of Domain Admin )

INTRODUCTION 
------------
BlackMarlinExec uses graph and analysis theory to reveal the hidden and unintended relationships within an Active Directory and Active Environment. 
Offensive Security can use BlackMarlinExec to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be Impossible to quickly 
identify. It also has it's own attack path management that continuously maps and quantifies Active Directory attack paths. Offensive Security can see 
thousand, even millions of attack paths within your existing architecture.

To get the dataset check out the instructions in the dataset folder.

( THIS TOOL IS FOR LEGAL PURPOSES ONLY! )

There are already several active directory tools available, however, none does
either support more than one protocol to find an attack path or support parallelized
connections.
